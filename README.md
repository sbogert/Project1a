# Project1a

so basically you're going to read in the input on flights, build a map of different flight paths
create functions to search through the map to find different path options plus costs

given a city of origin that you leave from, you return all teh different cities you can visit from P, the path needed to get there, and the cost of each trip

some kind of thing from 270 with searchign for all possible paths
look it up but that is basically the algorithm you need, already exists
